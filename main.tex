\begin{abstract}
This thesis is concerned with type-logical grammars and their practical applicability as tools of reasoning about sentence syntax and semantics.
The focal point is narrowed to Dutch, a language exhibiting a large degree of word order variability.
In order to overcome difficulties arising as a result of that variability, the thesis explores and expands upon a type grammar based on Multiplicative Intuitionistic Linear Logic, agnostic to word order but enriched with decorations that aim to reduce its proof-theoretic complexity.
An algorithm for the conversion of dependency-annotated sentences into type sequences is then implemented, populating the type logic with concrete, data-driven lexical types.
Two experiments are ran on the resulting grammar instantiation.
The first pertains to the learnability of the type-assignment process by a neural architecture. 
A novel application of a self-attentive sequence transduction model is proposed; contrary to established practices, it constructs types inductively by internalizing the type-formation syntax, thus exhibiting generalizability beyond a pre-specified type vocabulary.
The second revolves around a deductive parsing system that can resolve structural ambiguities by consulting both word and type information; preliminary results suggest both excellent computational efficiency and performance.

This thesis would not have been made possible without the ceaseless aid of my support committee;
Richard, who always took the time to listen to my ideas and assist in any problems I would encounter, but also kept a watchful eye for oversights I would otherwise be oblivious to, and
Tejaswini, who kept me motivated despite early failures, and was keen to point out novelty in results I considered trivial.
I could not overstate my luck in being able to work under Michael's supervision.
His expertise, resourcefulness and enthusiasm have inspired and permeated through every aspect of this work.

I would like to also express my gratitude towards my family for their unconditional encouragement; my father, the most reliable tech support in all matters imaginable, my mother, who willingly endures my complaining, and my sister, who keeps finding new ways to tease and amuse me.

\vspace{1.6em}
Parts of the thesis have benefitted from fruitful discussions with Vasilis Bountris and Giorgos Tziafas, for which I am thankful.
